## Build your REST APIs in minutes using loopback.io (a NodeJs Framework).

This workshop is aimed at gaining hands-on experience in developing intelligent text analysis platforms (for instance chatbots). 
Wanted to see how to do the following in a faster way within minutes. Come to our tech talk.

#### Key Topics:
- How to generate (CRUD + Most common ) REST Apis for your App.
- How to generate Models from the command line. (Model definition)
- How to link models from the command line. (Add relationships to your models in much more user-friendly way)
- How to migrate models from code to your preferred Databases (Mysql, SQL, MongoDB, etc).
- How to leverage on multi-database applications with a help of loopback-datasource-juggler. (Few tables on MySQL, few tables on MongoDB. ) Just for fun,
- How to add Custom (Business logic) APIs to your models. Basically about extending the default APIs provided for any model. (A common use case)

Demonstration of the above topics by building a simple app in Angular5 + Loopback.

Technology Stack: 
1. loopback (A NodeJs framework for building modular)
2. MySql. (Or Datasource of your choice)
3. Angular for frontend

Optional
1. You will learn, Containerized App Development workflow using Docker. 
2. Authentication using loopback-Passport Strategies.

Good News is Its Open Source:
- https://loopback.io
- https://github.com/strongloop/loopback
- https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-cli
We will be using loopback version 3.
Though loopback 4 is coming up entirely on the typescript. It's still too early. So we will write our backend in JS., not in TypeScript
