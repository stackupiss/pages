## NLP Based AI Systems - Text Analytics & Chatbots

This workshop is aimed at gaining hands-on experience in developing intelligent text analysis platforms (for instance chatbots). AI based chatbots and text analytics platforms are gaining immense traction in today's technological ecosystem. Several domains use text processing to extract valuable insights from external latent sources. One such domain happens to be one of the most profitable sectors of our society - Banking and trading. Financial systems use intelligent text parsing systems to extract insights to develop predictive analytics. Another such emerging domain is healthcare. Health information systems depend hugely on structured text data which can be parsed to carry out automated prognosis and disease staging.
